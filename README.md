# CP-Algorithms

This repository is dedicated to Competitive Programming (CP) study. It contains implementations of various algorithms and data structures, as well as solutions to practice problems.

## Structure

### Algorithms

The `Algorithms` folder contains implementations of various algorithms and data structures. Each subfolder is named after the algorithm or data structure it contains. Here are the current subfolders:

- **Binary Exponentiation**: Contains implementations related to binary exponentiation.
- **Breadth First Search**: Contains implementations of the BFS algorithm.
- **Depth First Search**: Contains implementations of the DFS algorithm.
- **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: Contains implementations of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.
- **Trial Division for Primes**: Contains implementations of the trial division algorithm for finding prime numbers.

### C2Ladder

The `C2Ladder` folder contains solutions to practice problems from the Codeforces C2 Ladder. Each subfolder is named after the difficulty level of the problems it contains. Here are the current subfolders:

- **1200**: Contains solutions to problems with a difficulty rating of 1200.

## How to Use

1. **Algorithms**: Navigate to the relevant subfolder in the `Algorithms` directory to find the implementation of the algorithm or data structure you are interested in.
2. **C2Ladder**: Navigate to the relevant subfolder in the `C2Ladder` directory to find solutions to practice problems. Each solution is contained in a separate file.
